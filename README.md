# ThompsonSampling
Thompson Sampling 

Thompson sampling is an algorithm for online decision problems where actions are taken sequentially in a manner that
must balance between exploiting what is known to maximize immediate performance and investing to accumulate
new information that may improve future performance. The
algorithm addresses a broad range of problems in a computationally efficient manner and is therefore enjoying wide
use.

The goal of this repository is to provide a number of Thompson Sampling examples that are more realistic and relevant to data scientists. For example, including change point detection methods.
